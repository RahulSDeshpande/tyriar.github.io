For those of you who don't know Web Platform was created with the following goal in mind, taken from the [welcome blog post][1]:

{% include post-image.html class="right-col" alt="Web Platform logo" src="/images/2012/10/15/wplogo.png" %}

> "The goal of this site is to be the place to come for answers to your trickiest (and simplest) development and design questions about the Open Web Platform."

It reminded me (and probably many others) of the [standards xkcd comic][3], but it has the backing of most of the industry leaders and I really think it has what it takes to become the definitive source for **quality** web development information. It already has a lot of good information from imports from existing databases/websites.

I think it's great and have already started contributing, so get involved! Here are some 5 minute tasks from the [Getting Started][4] page you can do to get going:

- Correct grammar and spelling mistakes
- Fill in missing compatibility information
- Fix non-semantic data
- Make biased content vendor-neutral
- Set appropriate flags
- Fix broken links
- Add more useful links
- Add code syntax coloring to code blocks
- Watch recent changes for improper changes.
