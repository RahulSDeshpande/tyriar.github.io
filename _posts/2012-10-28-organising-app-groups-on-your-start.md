intro       : Being a someone that is a little OCD about organisation, I was a little disappointed when I couldn't immediately figure out how to name the Windows 8 app groups on my new start screen. You can do it, it just may not be immediately obvious for everyone.

Here are the steps:

1. You need to zoom out first, you can do this using the standard zoom out shortcut (ctrl+mouse wheel down) or by clicking on the little dash button in the bottom-right corner of the screen.

   {% include post-image.html class="center-aligned" alt="Zoom out" src="/images/2012/10/28/zoom-out.png" %}

2. Right-click on the group you wish to name and hit the 'Name group' button in the context menu along the bottom of the screen

   {% include post-image.html class="center-aligned" alt="Naming" src="/images/2012/10/28/naming.png" %}

While in this zoomed out state you can also organise the groups by dragging and dropping

{% include post-image.html class="center-aligned" alt="Move" src="/images/2012/10/28/move.png" %}
