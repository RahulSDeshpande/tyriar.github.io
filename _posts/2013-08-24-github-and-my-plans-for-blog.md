intro       : Due to the issues of effectively source controlling the code on my blog using Blogger's text editor and Google Drive, I've gone ahead and extracted most of the code samples into a <a href="https://github.com/Tyriar/growing-with-the-web">GitHub project</a> for your viewing and forking pleasure.

I believe a blog post shouldn't be a write once, leave forever thing. It should be alive and keep up with the times, otherwise it could spread misinformation. Having my code samples source controlled will enable me to improve code or fix up old code much more easily.



## Future plans

Another idea I've been toying with for the last few months is to redo all my posts in [markdown][2] and I've started to implement my plan starting with this post. Not only is this far nicer than editing the raw HTML or using the WYSIWYG editor that Blogger provides, it will also allow me to transition off of Blogger far more easily when the time comes.
