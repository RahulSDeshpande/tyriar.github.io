intro       : The feature I've wanted for a very long time has finally arrived with Chromium v31; you can now inspect the <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code> pseudo-elements within the Chrome DevTools! It is such a great quality of life change for anyone who spends a decent amount of time tinkering with CSS.

Previously you would have to find the pseudo-element styles within the styles of the parent, there would be no selection of the pseudo-element in the viewport and the width and height wouldn't display.
