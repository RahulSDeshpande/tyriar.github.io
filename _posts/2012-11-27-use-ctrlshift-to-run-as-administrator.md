intro       : A handy little tip for developers using Windows 8. You can run an app as administrator by holding <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> and clicking an app tile.

This shortcut is derived from <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd></kbd> to run the selected application as administrator which has been present since Windows 7, possibly Vista too. This still works on the start screen of course, when using search or navigating using the arrow keys.
