How often does this happen to you?

{% include post-image.html class="center-aligned" alt="An unwanted autocomplete entry" src="/images/2012/09/27/autocomplete.png" %}

You start typing one of your commonly used web sites only to have your browser autocomplete to something a URL you don't want. It gets frustrating when you have to select the correct item over and over again.

There a little trick you can use in Chrome and Firefox to get around this annoyance:

1. Start typing the URL
2. Select the unwanted autocomplete entry
3. Hit <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Delete</kbd></kbd> to remove the entry from autocomplete

It shouldn't bother you again.
