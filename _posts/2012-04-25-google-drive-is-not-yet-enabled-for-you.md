intro       : I woke up this morning, started playing with my phone only to see that Google Drive has been released! I've been waiting for quite some time, having abandoned SugarSync a few weeks ago as I stopped using it a while ago due to what I felt was not the greatest integration with all my devices.

Not so fast! It is not enabled for my domain yet. So I went and investigated how to turn it on. Everything looked find with Docs and Drive settings. The problem was in my Google Apps domain settings, I was not on the Rapid Release track and I did not have new services set to automatic.

According to the official [Google Drive transition notes][1], it looks like I may not be able to get to use Drive for another 5 weeks. So... **Set your Google Apps domain to the rapid release track!**
