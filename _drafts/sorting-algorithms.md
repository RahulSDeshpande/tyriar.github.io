The study of sorting algorithms is a great way to improve your craft as a software developer as they provide relatively simple algorithms in order to practice complexity analysis and introduce clever solutions to a very simple problem.

## Properties of a sorting algorithm

| Property     | Description                                                                            |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Adaptability | An adaptive sort's performance improves the more sorted a list is initially            |
| In-place     | An in-place sort requires a constant amount of additional space                        |
| Parallelism  | A parallel sort can split its workload between multiple workers                        |
| Stability    | A stable sort preserves the order of items in the list that evaluate to the same value |
