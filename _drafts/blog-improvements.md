From old post:



- current state of editing (awesome)
- move towards higher fidelity assets SVG (I want it to look beautiful zoomed in)
- mathjax
- post-image class
- series
- cleaning up older posts
- removing jQuery
- site colours
- search

## My new workflow

Writing posts is so much nicer than in the past.

## Search

Slightly embarrassingly, back in I pro

## Goodbye sidebar

## Reducing resources

Over the past month I've reduced the amount of requests the home page makes from 75 to around 58, most of this was small but there were some heavy hitters like jQuery which I just don't feel I need anymore (or maybe I've just gotten less lazy).

## Dropping IE8 support

I've always made sure that my blog's content has been accessible to Internet Explorer 8. But now, considering the current browser usage stats and my wanting to push into newer web technologies with as little maintenance as possible I've decided to no longer support IE8. This will enable things like SVGs without fallbacks, HSL colour in CSS and moving the a newer version of jQuery.

## SVG

A quick look around and you'll notice some nice SVG

## Browser usage

I thought it would be a good opportunity to go through the current usage stats, fittingly, in all the scalable glory that is SVG.
