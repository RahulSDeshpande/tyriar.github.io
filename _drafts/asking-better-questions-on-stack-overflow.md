Stack Overflow is a brilliant resource for asking software development questions. There is a certain amount of etiquette you should follow though that isn't immediately obvious to new users. This article tries to clear this up so you can get down to asking great questions and helping the site, the industry and the web grow.



## Break your question down and Google it first

The amount of questions I've answered that I didn't know anything about before reading them would probably shock you. Unless your question is either very specific or is on a new technology, then it has probably been asked and answered before somewhere on the internet (likely Stack Overflow).

One part of this where I think people fail is to break down their problem into multiple sub-problems. Say you're having problems 



## Don't add the technology to the title just because

This is what tags are for, so don't include the language or technology in the title unless the question makes no sense or doesn't read well without it.

Consider for example the question:

> *Looping tables in ASP.NET MVC C# HTML*

Not only is this question badly worded, it contains information that isn't super important, namely C# and HTML. This would be a much better title:

> *Iterating over table rows with Razor"

As you can see it's far more clear what you want to accomplish and instead of ASP.NET MVC, the templating engine is included since it's more specific. ******** not clear cut, Iterating over table rows could apply to a lot of problems...





## Don't add \[SOLVED\] to the question

On the home screen this is indicated by the yellow colour of the answer count and on the question page you can check whether the top answer has a tick. Adding \[SOLVED\] to the question once it is answered just adds noise.



## Omit greetings and thank yous

Stack Overflow got so popular because of it's keen focus on the question and cutting down discussion as much as possible. Many users consider greetings and thank yous to be unessential noise on a question, you will often have these edited out by other users.

If you want to thank someone, give them an upvote.



## Include a [SSCCE][2]

Many people ask their first question on Stack Overflow, don't include any code and expect people to know the fix magically. You should always include example code for the question you're asking, ideally as the term goes *short, self contained and correct*.

For web development make sure you include an example on [jsFiddle][1] unless you're unable to do so. This is very likely the method that people will use to answer the question and you're just making it easier for them.

If you don't include an example you can expect to have your question closed. Always keep in mind that you're asking strangers that are professionals in their field for help, you should make it as easy as possible for them!



## Avoid link-only questions

...



## Formatting matters

Putting a little care into the formatting of the question, particularly code formatting and indentation will make reading it a significantly better experience for the people answering your question.



## Google it again

Really, when you have finished writing up the question try Googling it again now that you've hashed out all the details.
