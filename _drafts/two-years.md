intro       : Two years have passed since I posted my <a href="http://www.growingwiththeweb.com/2012/04/sass-syntactically-awesome-stylesheets.html">first article</a> on the blog. I wanted to look back and reflect on both blogging and life in the last year.

## My favourite posts this year

These are my favourite posts for the past year:

1. [*Binomial heap*](http://www.growingwiththeweb.com/2014/01/binomial-heap.html) - I always enjoy writing (and learning) about data structures, this article features the first time (and only to date) where I included some animations in the posts, they were done in hand-crafted SVG and turned out really nice.
2. [*A gentle introduction to Git*](http://www.growingwiththeweb.com/2014/02/a-gentle-introduction-to-git.html) - I wrote most of this article while I was learning Git but wasn't confident enough to publish it until several months after just so I could be sure I knew what I was talking about.
3. [*Languages and Chinese characters on the web*](http://www.growingwiththeweb.com/2014/03/languages-and-chinese-characters-on-the-web.html) - Languages and internationalization interest me, this post was the culmination of a lot of research and I learnt a lot.
4. [*Interview questions series*](http://www.growingwiththeweb.com/p/explore.html?t=Interview%20questions) - This series started as preparation for my Amazon interview, I found it pretty fun so continued to work on interview question articles afterwards.
5. [*Splay tree*](http://www.growingwiththeweb.com/2013/06/data-structure-splay-tree.html) - The other data structure article I wrote this year, this one is just a really handy data structure to know about.
