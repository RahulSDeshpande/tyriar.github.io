My name is Daniel Imms, I'm a software engineer and web developer from Australia living in Seattle, Washington. I'm passionate about developing great software and have worked with quite a broad range of technologies to date.



## My background

Computers have been a very large part of my life since I was around 5 years old. I quickly mastered the DOS commands on the family IBM 286 to navigate folder structures, and install and run games like Commander Keen and Prince of Persia.

I enjoyed gaming so much, at 10 years of age I investigated how I would go about creating them. So I hit the internet and came across game development tools like RPG Maker and GameMaker. Eventually I started to feel confined by the limits that these tools imposed on me and wanted more control, this naturally led me to more sophisticated platforms like VB, [Java][1], C, C++ and later [C#][2]. When I entered high school, any classes on computer programming seemed trivial to me and I'd always score top with very little effort.

My early career focus was largely been towards .NET and web development. Currently I'm primarily working on Chromium, Blink and Telemetry for the cloud-backed Silk Browser. At home I keep up to date on everything web development by writing for my blog.

It's my philosophy that a software engineer can never know enough about languages that are not their primary language, it just widens your thinking. One of the things I'm most appreciative from my university career was how harsh the courses seemed to be when introducing new languages, this taught me the ability to pick them up very quickly.

Since 2012 I have been posting on my blog regularly, I'm also occasionally active on [Stack Overflow][5] when the mood strikes. I use these as platforms to continue learning and revising my existing knowledge on all things software development. Growing with the Web is primarily focused on web development, software engineering and computer science topics.



## Where I've worked

I'm currently at [Amazon][6] working on the Silk which is an AWS-backed Android-based browser for Kindle Fire. Most of my experience before this was in the .NET/web Development space, here are the places I've worked in the past:

- Senior ASP.NET Developer at Shared Services, ACT Government
- .NET Developer at F1 Solutions
- Software Engineer at CEA Technologies



## Some of my favorite languages

- [C#][2]
- [JavaScript][10]
- [Dart][7]
- [Sass][8]
- [Markdown][9]
