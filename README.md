## Licenses

The site source code itself is not released under a license, meaning there are [restrictions][2] as to what you can do with it. I'm releasing the source code purely as an educational tool to demonstrate how I've set it up and how various parts have been optimised.

For the code within the blog's articles, see the [code license][3] page.
